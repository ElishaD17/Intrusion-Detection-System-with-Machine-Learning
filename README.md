# **Intrusion Detection System with Machine Learning**

## **Description**
In the rapidly evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the expansion of computer networks has led to increased vulnerability to cyber-attacks, posing significant threats to data integrity and economic stability. This project employs machine learning techniques to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that accurately and efficiently classifies network traffic as normal or malicious. By enhancing network security measures, it aims to protect infrastructure from cyber threats. The project focuses on optimizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for superior detection accuracy using the NSL-KDD dataset.

### **Usage**
Execute the main script to run the Intrusion Detection System:
```
python main.py
```
*Note: Replace `main.py` with the path to your project's main executable script.*

## **Methodology & Data**
This project applies machine learning algorithms to the NSL-KDD dataset, a renowned dataset for evaluating intrusion detection systems. With 43 features tracking various aspects of network connections classified into normal and malicious traffic, the dataset serves as the foundation for this research. The project encompasses data preprocessing, feature selection, model training (with a focus on Decision Trees, KNN, and Naive Bayes), and evaluation, showcasing KNN's outstanding accuracy and recall.
