#Intrusion Detection System with Machine Learning
#Description
#In the rapidly evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the expansion of computer networks has led to an increased vulnerability to cyber-attacks, posing a significant threat to data integrity and economic stability. This project leverages machine learning techniques to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that accurately and efficiently classifies network traffic as normal or malicious, thereby enhancing network security measures and protecting infrastructure from cyber threats. Utilizing the NSL-KDD dataset, the project explores various machine learning models, with a focus on optimizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for superior detection accuracy.
